## **Blue0x Node Rewards Program**

The Node Reward Program is an initiative to incentivize Blue0x users to host Blue0x nodes to increase the overall security and decentralization of the Blue0x Network.

### Current reward per active node

- `2 BLX/day/node` for as long as the node is connected.

- `2 BLX Currency/day/node` of the respective country that the node is in, based on IP address.

If you would like to deploy a public node, follow this [tutorial](getting-started/deploy-public-node.mdx).
