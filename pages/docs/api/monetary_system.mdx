## Monetary System Operations

### Can Delete Currency

Determine if a currency can be deleted.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `canDeleteCurrency`
- `account` is the account ID
- `currency` is the currency ID
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Note:** a currency can be deleted only when all units of the currency are held by `account`. A reservable currency that has not yet been issued can be deleted by the issuer. A mintable currency that has not completed minting cannot be deleted by a non-issuer.

**Example:** Refer to [Can Delete Currency](examples2.mdx#can-delete-currency) example.

### Currency Buy / Sell

Make an exchange request to buy or sell an exchangeable currency. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-request 'The Blue0x API') for common parameters.

- `currency` is the currency ID
- `rateNQT` is the exchange rate (in NQT per QNT)
- `units` is the amount of the currency to buy or sell (in QNT)

**Note:** An exchange request is immediately executed once accepted onto the blockchain based only on currently available offers (refer to [Publish Exchange Offer](#publish-exchange-offer 'The Blue0x API')). The request then expires, regardless of the amount of currency exchanged; the request may be completely filled, partially filled, or expire without any exchange if no matching offers are found.

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response).

**Example:** Refer to [Currency Buy / Sell](examples2.mdx#currency-buy--sell) example.

#### Currency Buy

Refer to [Currency Buy / Sell](#currency-buy--sell).

#### Currency Sell

Refer to [Currency Buy / Sell](#currency-buy--sell).

### Currency Mint

**Note:** An additional `amountPerUnitNQT` \* `reserveSupply` NQT (beyond what has previously been reserved) will be locked until the `issuanceHeight` is reached. Upon issuance, if the currency is claimable the NQT will remain locked until claimed; otherwise the NQT will transfer to the issuing account. Also upon issuance, a portion of the `reserveSupply` QNT will be transfered to each reserving account in proportion to the NQT that was contributed.

### Get Minting Target

Get the current minting target of a mintable currency.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getMintingTarget`
- `currency` is the mintable currency ID

- `units` is the amount (in QNT) of currency to mint
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Note:** `units` cannot be greater than 1/10000 of the `maxSupply` (refer to [Issue Currency](#issue-currency 'The Blue0x API')). Increasing `units` decreases `targetBytes`.

**Response:**

- `difficulty` (S) is the current difficulty, an estimate of the number of hashes needed to meet the target
- `targetBytes` (S) is the 32-byte target (little endian), which must equal or exceed the computed hash of the `nonce`
- `currency` (S) is the currency ID
- `counter` (N) is the counter associated with the minting account, the value previously submitted to [Currency Mint](#currency-mint 'The Blue0x API')
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** If a `nonce` is found such that its hash is less than the target, it can be submitted to the blockchain along with `counter` + 1 using [Currency Mint](#currency-mint 'The Blue0x API'), which results in `units` NQT being credited to the minting account. `difficulty` is inversely related to the target, and so increases exponentially as `maxSupply` is approached because the target is defined as (2exp\-1)/`units`, where exp decreases linearly from 256-`minDifficulty` to 256-`maxDifficulty`. (Refer to [Issue Currency](#issue-currency 'The Blue0x API') for `maxSupply`, `minDifficulty` and `maxDifficulty`.)

**Example:** Refer to [Get Minting Target](examples2.mdx#get-minting-target) example.
