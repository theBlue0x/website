## Utilities

### Decode QR Code

Decodes a base64-encoded jpeg to a UTF-8 string. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `decodeQRCode`
- `qrCodeBase64` is a base64-encoded jpeg string to be decoded

**Response**

- `qrCodeData` (S) is a UTF-8 string containing the decoded data from the base64 string
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Decode QR Code](examples2.mdx#decode-qr-code) example.

### Detect Mime Type

Gets the mime type of uploaded file or data.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `detectMimeType`
- `data` is the data (optional)
- `file` is the pathname of a data file to upload (optional if `data` provided)
- `filename` is a filename to associate with `data` (optional if `file` uploaded in which case the uploaded filename is always used)
- `isText` is `false` if `data` is a hex string (optional)

**Response**

- `type` (S) is the mime type
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Detect Mime Type](examples2.mdx#detect-mime-type) example.

### Encode QR Code

Encodes a UTF-8 string to a base64-encoded jpeg. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `encodeQRCode`
- `qrCodeData` is a UTF-8 text string to be encoded
- `width` is the width of the output image (optional)
- `height` is the height of the output image (optional)

**Response**

- `qrCodeBase64` (S) is a base64 string encoding a jpeg image of the QR code
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Encode QR Code](examples2.mdx#encode-qr-code) example.

### Full Hash To Id

Converts a full hash to an ID.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `fullHashToId`
- `fullHash` is the full hash 64-digit (32-byte) hex string

**Response:**

- `stringId` (S) is the ID corresponding to the hash, in the form of an decimal string
- `longId` (S) is the signed long integer (8-bytes) representation of the ID used internally, returned as a string
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Full Hash To Id](examples2.mdx#full-hash-to-id) example.

### Hash

Calculates the hash of a secret for use in [phased transactions](phasing.mdx#create-phasing-poll 'The Blue0x API') with voting model 5 (`Vote By Secret`).

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `hash`
- `hashAlgorithm` is the hash function used: `2` for SHA256, `3` for SHA3, `5` for SCRYPT, `6` for RIPEMD160, `25` for Keccack25 and `62` for SHA256 followed by RIPEMD160, according to [Get Constants](server.mdx#get-constants 'The Blue0x API')
- `secret` is a secret phrase in text form or hex string form
- `secretIsText` is `true` if `secret` is text, `false` if it is a hex string (optional)

**Note:** `secret` is converted from a hex string to a byte array, which is what the hash algorithm expects, unless `secretIsText` is `true`, in which case `secret` is first converted from text to a UTF-8 hex string as by [Hex Convert](#hex-convert 'The Blue0x API').

**Response:**

- `hash` (S) is the hash of the secret, in the form of a hex string
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Hash](examples2.mdx#hash) example.

### Hex Convert

Converts a text string into a UTF-8 hex string and if the text input is already a hex string, also into text.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `hexConvert`
- `string` is a text string, possibly a hex string

**Response:**

- `binary` (S) is the converted UTF-8 hex string
- `text` (S) is a text string converted from `string` if it is a valid UTF-8 hex string
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Hex Convert](examples2.mdx#hex-convert) example.

### Long Convert

Converts an ID to the signed long integer representation used internally.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `longConvert`
- `id` is a numerical ID, in decimal form but equivalent to an 8-byte unsigned integer as produced by SHA-256 hashing

**Response:**

- `stringId` (S) is the numerical ID
- `longId` (S) is the signed long integer (8-bytes) representation of the ID used internally, returned as a string
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Long Convert](examples2.mdx#long-convert) example.

### RS Convert

Get both the Reed-Solomon account address and the account number given an account ID.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `rsConvert`
- `account` is an account ID (either RS address or number)

**Response:**

- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)
- `account` (S) is the account number

**Example:** Refer to [RS Convert](examples2.mdx#rs-convert) example.
