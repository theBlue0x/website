### Verify Prunable Message

Verify that a prunable message obtained from any source, when hashed, matches the hash of the original prunable message.

**Request:** Refer to [Send Message](#send-message 'The Blue0x API') for more details about the following request parameters.

- `requestType` is `verifyPrunableMessage`
- `message` is the plain message, if applicable (optional)
- `messageIsText` is `false` if the provided plain `message` is a hex string (optional)
- `encryptedMessageData` is the data part of the encrypted data-nonce pair (optional if `message` provided)

**Note:** The hash is computed from the message itself plus its associated flag(s) `isText` and `isCompressed` (encrypted only); therefore the flag(s) must be provided for verification if different from the default(s). The original `encryptedMessageData-encryptedMessageNonce` pair used to compute the original hash must be provided again to recompute the hash for verification of a prunable encrypted message.

**Response:**

- `version.PrunablePlainMessage` or `version.PrunableEncryptedMessage` (N) is `1`, the version number

  - `data` (S)
  - `nonce` (B)
  - `isText` (B)
  - `isCompressed` (B)
- `messageIsText` (B) is `true` if the plain message is text, `false` if it is a hex string, if applicable
