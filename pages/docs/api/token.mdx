## Token Operations

### Decode File Token

Validate a file token without requiring the transmission of a secret passphrase. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `decodeFileToken`
- `file` is the path to the file that was signed
- `token` is the token of the `file`, as generated by [Generate File Token](#generate-file-token 'The Blue0x API')

**Response:**

- `account` (S) is the account number that generated the token
- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
- `timestamp` (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
- `valid` (B) is `true` if token is valid, `false` otherwise
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since `token` contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, `file` can be validated as signed by the owner of the public key, and the public key determines the account ID.

**Example:** Refer to [Decode File Token](examples2.mdx#decode-file-token) example.

### Decode Token

Validate a token without requiring the transmission of a secret passphrase.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `decodeToken`
- `website` is the signed text, typically an authorized URL
- `token` is the token generated by [Generate Token](#generate-token 'The Blue0x API')

**Response:**

- `account` (S) is the account number that generated the token
- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
- `timestamp` (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was created
- `valid` (B) is `true` if token is valid, `false` otherwise
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since `token` contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, `website` can be validated as authorized by the owner of the public key, and the public key determines the account ID.

**Example:** Refer to [Decode Token](examples2.mdx#decode-token) example.

### Generate File Token

Generate a file token. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `generateFileToken`
- `secretPhrase` is the passphrase of the account generating the token
- `file` is the path to the file to be signed

**Response:**

- `token` (S) is a 160 character string representing the 100-byte token which consists of a 32-byte public key, a 4-byte timestamp, and a 64-byte digital signature
- `account` (S) is the account number corresponding to `secretPhrase`
- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
- `timestamp` (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
- `valid` (B) is true if token is valid, false otherwise
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since `token` contains the token generator's public key and digital signature, the `file` can be validated as digitally signed by the owner of the public key using [Decode File Token](#decode-file-token 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Generate File Token](examples2.mdx#generate-file-token) example.

### Generate Token

Generate a token. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `generateToken`
- `secretPhrase` is the passphrase of the account generating the token
- `website` is a web site URL for which authorization should be granted, or general text to be digitally signed

**Note:** `website` is typically a URL (with the leading https:// unnecessary) that an account owner signs with his `secretPhrase` (private key) to bind the account to the URL, but `website` can be any text that the owner wishes to sign.

**Response:**

- `token` (S) is a 160 character string representing the 100-byte token which consists of a 32-byte public key, a 4-byte timestamp, and a 64-byte signature
- `account` (S) is the account number corresponding to `secretPhrase`
- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
- `timestamp` (N) is the time (in seconds since the genesis block) that the token was generated
- `valid` (B) is `true` if token is valid, `false` otherwise
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** Since `token` contains the token generator's public key and signature, the `website` can be validated as authorized by the owner of the public key using [Decode Token](#decode-token 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Generate Token](examples2.mdx#generate-token) example.
