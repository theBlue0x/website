## Voting System Operations

### Cast Vote

Cast a vote on a poll. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-request 'The Blue0x API') for common parameters.

- `requestType` is `castVote`
- `poll` is the poll ID
- `vote00` is an integer within the allowed range to vote for option (answer) 0 (optional if `minNumberOfOptions` met, default is `\-128`)
- `vote01` is an integer within the allowed range to vote for option (answer) 1 (optional if `minNumberOfOptions` met, default is `\-128`)
- `vote02` is an integer within the allowed range to vote for option (answer) 2 (optional if `minNumberOfOptions` met, default is `\-128`)

**Note:** The allowed vote values are integers between `minRangeValue` and `maxRangeValue`, inclusive. This range, along with the minimum and maximum number of options that can and must be voted on are specified when the poll is created. Refer to [Create Poll](#create-poll 'The Blue0x API').

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Cast Vote](examples2.mdx#cast-vote) example.
