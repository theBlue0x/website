## Shuffling Operations

Coin shuffling can be used to perform mixing of BLX, MS currencies (unless created as non-shuffleable), or AE assets. Any account can create a new shuffling, specifying the holding to be shuffled, the shuffle amount, number of participants required, and registration deadline.
