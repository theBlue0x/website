## Block Operations

### Get Block

Get a block object given a block ID or block height.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getBlock`
- `block` is the block ID (optional)
- `height` is the block height (optional if `block` provided)
- `timestamp` is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the block (optional if `height` provided)
- `includeTransactions` is `true` to include transaction details (optional)
- `includeExecutedPhased` is `true` to include approved and executed phased transactions (optional)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Note:** `block` overrides `height` which overrides `timestamp`.

**Response:**

- `previousBlockHash` (S) is the 32-byte hash of the previous block
- `payloadLength` (N) is the length (in bytes) of all transactions included in the block
- `totalAmountNQT` (S) is the total amount (in NQT) of the transactions in the block
- `generationSignature` (S) is the 32-byte generation signature of the generating account
- `generator` (S) is the generating account number
- `generatorPublicKey` (S) is the 32-byte public key of the generating account
- `baseTarget` (S) is the base target for the next block generation
- `payloadHash` (S) is the 32-byte hash of the payload (all transactions)
- `generatorRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the generating account
- `nextBlock` (S) is the next block ID
- `numberOfTransactions` (N) is the number of transactions in the block
- `blockSignature` (S) is the 64-byte block signature
- `transactions` (A) is an array of transaction IDs or transaction objects (if `includeTransactions` provided, refer to [Get Transaction](transactions.mdx#get-transaction) for details)
- `executedPhasedTransactions` (A) is an array of transaction IDs or transaction objects (if `includeExecutedPhased` provided, refer to [Get Transaction](transactions.mdx#get-transaction) for details)
- `version` (N) is the block version
- `totalFeeNQT` (S) is the total fee (in NQT) of the transactions in the block
- `previousBlock` (S) is the previous block ID
- `cumulativeDifficulty` (S) is the cumulative difficulty for the next block generation
- `block` (S) is the block ID
- `height` (N) is the zero-based block height
- `timestamp` (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the block
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Get Block](examples.mdx#get-block) example.

### Get Block Id

Get a block ID given a block height.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getBlockId`
- `height` is the block height
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Response:**

- `block` (S) is the block ID
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Get Block Id](examples.mdx#get-block-id) example.

### Get Blocks

Get blocks from the blockchain in reverse block height order.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getBlocks`
- `timestamp` is the earliest block (in seconds since the genesis block) to retrieve (optional)
- `firstIndex` is first block to retrieve (optional, default is zero or the last block on the blockchain)
- `lastIndex` is the last block to retrieve (optional, default is `firstIndex` + 99)
- `includeTransactions` is `true` to include transaction details (optional)
- `includeExecutedPhased` is `true` to include approved and executed phased transactions (optional)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Response:**

- `blocks` (A) is an array of blocks retrieved (refer to [Get Block](#get-block) for details)
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Get Blocks](examples.mdx#get-blocks) example.

### Get EC Block

Get Economic Cluster block data.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getECBlock`
- `timestamp` is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the EC block (optional, default (or zero) is the current timestamp)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Note:** If `timestamp` is more than 15 seconds before the timestamp of the last block on the blockchain, `errorCode` 4 is returned.

**Response:**

- `ecBlockHeight` (N) is the EC block height
- `ecBlockId` (S) is the EC block ID
- `timestamp` (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) of the EC block
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Get EC Block](examples.mdx#get-ec-block) example.
