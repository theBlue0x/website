## Forging Operations

### Start / Stop / Get Forging

Start or stop forging with an account, or check to see if an account is forging. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is either `startForging`, `stopForging` or `getForging`
- `secretPhrase` is the secret passphrase of the account (optional for `stopForging` and `getForging` if password protected like the [Debug Operations](debug.mdx))

**Response:**

- `deadline` (N) is the estimated time (in seconds since the last block) until the account will forge a block (`startForging` and `getForging` only)
- `hitTime` (N) is the estimated time (in seconds since the genesis block) when the account will forge a block (`startForging` and `getForging` only)
- `remaining` (N) is the deadline less the elapsed time since the last block (`getForging` only)
- `foundAndStopped` (B) is `true` if forging was stopped, `false` if forging was already stopped (`stopForging` only)
- `account` (S) is the account number (`getForging` only)
- `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account (`getForging` only)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Note:** A `getForging` request returns `errorCode` 5 if the account is not forging. If the account has a zero `effectiveBalance`, forging can be started but `deadline`, `remainingTime` and `hitTime` will be set to zero.

**Example:** Refer to [Start / Stop / Get Forging](examples#start--stop--get-forging) example.

#### Get Forging

Refer to [Start / Stop / Get Forging](#start--stop--get-forging).

#### Start Forging

Refer to [Start / Stop / Get Forging](#start--stop--get-forging).

#### Stop Forging

Refer to [Start / Stop / Get Forging](#start--stop--get-forging).

### Lease Balance

Lease the entire guaranteed balance of Blue0x to another account, after 1440 confirmations. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-request) for common parameters.

- `requestType` is `leaseBalance`
- `period` is the lease period (in number of blocks, 1440 minimum)
- `recipient` is the lessee (recipient) account
- `recipientPublicKey` is the public key of the lessee (recipient) account (optional, enhances security of a new account)

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response).

**Example:** Refer to [Lease Balance](examples.mdx#lease-balance) example.

### Get Next Block Generators

Returns the next block generators ordered by hit time. The list of currently active forgers is first initialized using the block generators with at least 2 blocks generated within the previous 10,000 blocks, excluding accounts without a public key. The list is updated as new blocks are processed. The results are not 100% correct since previously active generators may no longer be running and new generators won't be known until they generate a block.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `getNextBlockGenerators`
- `limit` (N) is the number of next block generators to display.

**Response:**

- `activeCount` (N) is the number of active forging accounts
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain
- `generators` (A) is an array containing the number of next block generators requested
  - `effectiveBalanceNXT` (N) is the balance (in BLX) of the account available for forging: the unleased guaranteedBalance of this account plus the leased guaranteedBalance of all lessors to this account
  - `accountRS` (S) is the Reed-Solomon address of the account
  - `deadline` (N) is the estimated time (in seconds since the last block) until the account will forge a block
  - `account` (S) is the account number
  - `hitTime` (N) is the estimated time (in seconds since the genesis block) when the account will forge a block
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)
- `timestamp` (N) is the timestamp (in seconds since the genesis block) when the request was executed
- `height` (N) is the height of the blockchain

**Example:** Refer to [Get Next Block Generators](examples.mdx#get-next-block-generators) example.
