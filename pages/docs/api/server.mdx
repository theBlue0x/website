## Server Information Operations

### Event Register

Create, modify or remove an event listener which can report server events via [Event Wait](#event`Wait 'The Blue0x API'). POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `eventRegister`
- `event` is one of multiple server events from the following list of event names: (optional, default is all possible events)
  - Block.BLOCK\-GENERATED
  - Block.BLOCK\-POPPED
  - Block.BLOCK\-PUSHED
  - Peer.ADD\-INBOUND
  - Peer.ADDED\-ACTIVE\-PEER
  - Peer.BLACKLIST
  - Peer.CHANGED\-ACTIVE\-PEER
  - Peer.DEACTIVATE
  - Peer.NEW\-PEER
  - Peer.REMOVE
  - Peer.REMOVE\-INBOUND
  - Peer.UNBLACKLIST
  - Transaction.ADDED\-CONFIRMED\-TRANSACTIONS
  - Transaction.ADDED\-UNCONFIRMED\-TRANSACTIONS
  - Transaction.REJECT\-PHASED\-TRANSACTION
  - Transaction.RELEASE\-PHASED\-TRANSACTION
  - Transaction.REMOVE\-UNCONFIRMED\-TRANSACTIONS
- `event` is one of multiple server events (optional)
- `add` is `true` to add events to an existing listener (optional, omit if `remove` is `true`)
- `remove` is `true` to remove events from an existing listener (optional, omit if `add` is `true`)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Note:** To create a new event listener, omit both `add` and `remove`. To remove an existing event listener, set `remove` to `true` and omit `event`; all registered events will be removed, any outstanding [Event Wait](#event`Wait 'The Blue0x API') will be completed and the listener will be deactivated.

**Note:** An event listener is automatically deactivated whenever all registered events are removed or if [Event Wait](#event`Wait 'The Blue0x API') is not called frequently enough, according to the `nxt.apiEventTimeout` property. The timeout is not precise; the removal process runs every `nxt.apiEventTimeout` / 2 seconds, so that many extra seconds may elapse before removal; the first [Event Wait](#event`Wait 'The Blue0x API') call should be made immediately after registration to avoid deactivation.

**Note:** Each API user (with a unique address) can create only one event listener. When a new one is created, it will replace an existing one. The maximum number of unique users is controlled by the `nxt.maxEventUsers` property.

**Response:**

- `registered` is `true` if the operation completed successfully
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)
- `requestProcessingTime` (N) is the API request processing time (in millisec)

**Example:** Refer to [Event Register](examples2.mdx#event-register) example.

### Event Wait

Wait for events registered with [Event Register](#event-register 'The Blue0x API'). POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `eventWait`
- `timeout` is the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for an event before the call returns (optional, default and maximum is the nxt.apiEventTimeout property)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Notes:** The call returns immediately if one or more events have occurred since the last call; multiple events are all returned together. If a new call is made before the last one returns, the `timeout` timer resets to the new value. Event registration expires if wait calls are not made frequently enough, according to the `nxt.apiEventTimeout` property.

**Response:**

- `events` (A) is an array of event objects each of which has the following fields:
  - `name` (S) is the name of the event (refer to [Event Register](#event-register 'The Blue0x API') for the list of event names)

    - block string identifier (S) for a block event
    - peer network address (S) for a peer event
    - transaction string identifier (S) for a transaction event
- `lastBlock` (S) is the last block ID on the blockchain (applies if `requireBlock` is provided but not `requireLastBlock`)

**Example:** Refer to [Event Wait](examples2.mdx#event-wait) example.
