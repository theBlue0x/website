## Alias Operations

### Buy / Sell Alias

Buy or sell an alias. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](createtransaction.mdx#create-transaction-request) for common parameters.

- `requestType` is either `buyAlias` or `sellAlias`
- `alias` is the ID of the alias (optional)
- `aliasName` is the alias name (optional if `alias` provided)
- `priceNQT` is the asking price (in NQT) of the alias (`sellAlias` only)
- `amountNQT` is the amount (in NQT) offered for an alias for sale (`buyAlias` only)
- `recipient` is the account ID of the recipient (only required for `sellAlias` and only if there is a designated recipient)
- `recipientPublicKey` is the public key of the recipient account (only applicable if `recipient` provided; optional, enhances security of a new account)

**Note**: An alias can be transferred rather than sold by setting `priceNQT to zero. A pending sale can be canceled by selling again to self for a price of zero.
