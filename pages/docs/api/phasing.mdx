## Phasing Operations

### Approve Transaction

Approve (vote for) a phased transaction. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-request 'The Blue0x API') for common parameters.

- `requestType` is `approveTransaction`
- `transactionFullHash` is the full hash of the transaction to be approved (may be used up to 10 times per API request)
- `revealedSecret` is the secret phrase (required only for `phasingVotingModel 5`, refer to [Create Phasing Poll](#create-phasing-poll 'The Blue0x API'))
- `revealedSecretIsText` is a way of specifying whether revealedSecret is text or binary.

**Note:** This transaction will be accepted in the blockchain only if all phased transactions it is voting for are already in it.

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Approve Transaction](examples2.mdx#approve-transaction) example.

### Create Phasing Poll

Create a phased transaction with conditional deferred execution based on the result of a vote, on a list of linked transactions or on the revelation of a secret; or simply with unconditional deferred execution. POST only.

**Request:** Refer to [Create Transaction Request](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-request 'The Blue0x API') for common parameters.

- `requestType` is any type from the [Create Transaction](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction 'The Blue0x API') list which is phasing-safe, indicated with italics such as `send Money`
- `phased` is `true` to create a phased transaction (optional but required for all of the following parameters, which are all optional for unphased transactions)
- `phasingFinishHeight` is the block height at which the poll will finish; the transaction will be executed at this block height only if all conditions (if any) have been met, otherwise the transaction will never be executed
- `phasingVotingModel` is an integer code for the method of approval:
  - `-1` for `None`
  - `0` for `Vote By Account`
  - `1` for `Vote By Account Balance`
  - `2` for `Vote By Asset Balance`
  - `3` for `Vote By Currency Balance`
  - `4` for `by Linked Transactions`
  - `5` for `by Secret`
- `phasingQuorum` is the number of "votes" needed for transaction approval (required if `phasingVotingModel` >= `0`, default `0`):
  - `0` for voting model `-1`
  - `the number of accounts` for model `0`
  - `total NQT` for model `1`
  - `total QNT` for models `2` and `3`
  - `the number of transactions` for model `4`
  - `1` for model `5`
- `phasingMinBalance` is the minimum balance (in NQT or QNT) required for voting (optional, default `0`)
- `phasingMinBalanceModel` is (required if `phasingMinBalance` > `0`, must match `phasingVotingModel` when `phasingVotingModel` = `1`, `2` or `3`):
  - `1` for BLX balance
  - `2` for an asset balance
  - `3` for a currency balance
- `phasingHolding` is the asset or currency ID (required if `phasingMinBalanceModel` = `2` or `3`)
- `phasingWhitelisted` is the account ID of an account allowed to vote for the transaction; once used, `only` whitelisted accounts are allowed to vote (optional, may be used up to ten times per API request)
- `phasingLinkedFullHash` is the full hash of a transaction that must be in the blockchain at the `phasingFinishHeight`; transactions already in the blockchain before the acceptance of the phased transaction can also be linked, as long as they are not more than 60 days old, or themselves phased transactions (required only for voting model `4`, may be used up to ten times per API request)
- `phasingHashedSecret` is the hash of a secret phrase (up to 100 bytes long) required for approval (required only for voting model `5`)
- `phasingHashedSecretAlgorithm` is the hash function used: `2` for SHA256, `6` for RIPEMD160 and `62` for SHA256 followed by RIPEMD160, according to [Get Constants](server.mdx#get-constants 'The Blue0x API') (required for a `phasingHashedSecret`)

**Note:** When a balance affects the poll result, the result depends only on the balance (including pending outgoing phased transfers) computed just prior to the finish height.

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Create Phasing Poll](examples2.mdx#create-phasing-poll) example.
