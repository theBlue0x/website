## Tagged Data Operations

Tagged data are similar to [prunable](index.mdx#prunable-data 'The Blue0x API') plain messages without a recipient, but with additional searchable metadata fields.

### Download Tagged Data

Download tagged data as a file if it is still available.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `downloadTaggedData`
- `transaction` is the transaction ID of the tagged data
- `retrieve` is `true` to retrieve pruned data from other nodes if not available (optional)
- `requireBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be present in the blockchain during execution (optional)
- `requireLastBlock` is the block ID of a block that must be last in the blockchain during execution (optional)

**Response:** The downloaded data file named `nxt`, unless there is an error in the request.

**Example:** Refer to [Download Tagged Data](examples2.mdx#download-tagged-data) example.

### Extend Tagged Data

Extend the expiration time of already uploaded tagged data. POST only.

**Request:**

- `requestType` is `extendTaggedData`
- `transaction` is the transaction ID of the tagged data
- `data` is the tagged data (optional)
- `file` is the pathname of a data file to upload (optional if `data` provided)
- `filename`
- `name`
- `description`
- `tags`
- `type`
- `channel`
- `isText`

**Note:** The `data` and metadata (`filename`, `name`, `description`, `tags`, `type`, `channel` and `isText`) parameters can be omitted if the tagged data has not yet expired; otherwise, the tagged data can be restored to the blockchain only if these fields have exactly the same values as when the data was uploaded (refer to [Upload Tagged Data](#upload-tagged-data 'The Blue0x API')).

**Note:** Anyone can submit an extension, not only the original uploader. Each extend transaction increases the expiration deadline by two weeks (24 hours on Testnet). Extending an existing tagged data from another account does not change the original submitter account ID by which it is indexed and searchable.

**Response:** Refer to [Create Transaction Response](create_transaction.mdx#create-transaction-response 'The Blue0x API').

**Example:** Refer to [Extend Tagged Data](examples2.mdx#extend-tagged-data) example.
