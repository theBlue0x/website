## **Blue0x Currencies**

Blue0x Currencies are a medium of exchange for real-world goods and services. In short, they are money accepted as a method of payment in their respective regions. Each currency is issued with a total supply and no additional units can be created beyond that total supply.

All Blue0x Currencies are exchangeable with one another, which lays the groundwork for a state of the art, international payment system.

_Blue0x Currency transactions require a 0.01 BLX fee to be executed._
