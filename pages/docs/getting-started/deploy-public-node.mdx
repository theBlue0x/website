## **Deploy a Public Blue0x Node**

**Sign up for a VPS (Virtual Private Server) with a provider like [DigitalOcean.com](https://m.do.co/c/97a921447f80)**

> These instructions assume you are using DigitalOcean, but other VPS providers are similar.

[DigitalOcean $200 Credit for All New Users](https://m.do.co/c/97a921447f80)

[![DigitalOcean Referral Badge](https://web-platforms.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%203.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=97a921447f80&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)

**Once signed up you will have a $200 credit for 60 days**

> The $5 monthly plan covers 1 month of computing for 1 server with 1 GB RAM and 25 GB storage. This is sufficient, but not ideal. The $10 monthly plan, with 2 GB RAM and 50 GB storage, is better suited to run the Blue0x software.

**Create your first Droplet**

    - Click `Create` and then `Droplet` from the dropdown menu.

- Select `Ubuntu 20.04(LTS) x64`

- Select the `Basic`, `Regular Intel with SSD`, and either the $5/mo or $10/mo option.

- Choose any `datacenter` that you would like.

- Enter a secure `root password`. You will need this later.

- Choose a `hostname `if you would like or leave it as default.

- Click `Create Droplet`.

- In a few moments, your new VPS will be ready to go.

**Connect to your new Droplet**

    - If you are on `Windows`, download [Putty.](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html )  Once installed, fill in the `IP Address of your VPS` into the `Host Name` field. Confirm that the `Port` is set to `22` and that the `Connection type` is `SSH`.  In the `Connection` subheading, under `SSH` ensure `2` is selected under `SSH protocol version`. Under `Data` subheading, enter `root` as `Auto-login username`.  You may then connect by clicking `Open`.  Once started, you will then need to enter the password you specified in the last step.

    - If you are on a `Mac`, you can use terminal, which is built into MacOS.

    - If you are on a `Linux` system, you can use any shell to connect via `ssh root@IP_ADDRESS_VPS`.

**After logged in to your VPS, install Java**

    - Run the following commands in your terminal

      ```bash copy
      sudo apt update
      ```

      ```bash copy
      sudo apt install default-jdk
      ```

**Download and run Blue0x**

    - Run the following commands in your terminal
      ```bash copy
      git clone https://github.com/theBlue0x/node.git
      ```
      ```bash copy
      cd node
      ```
      ```bash copy
      ./compile.sh
      ```
      ```bash copy
      ./run.sh
      ```
    - You will see a message indicating that the node is running at `localhost:2022`

    - In your favorite browser, open `IP_ADDRESS_OF_VPS:2022/index.html`

    - You will see the Blue0x Login Screen.

    - Click `Create Your Account`.

    - Save and securely store your new account passphrase.

    - Once you are done setting up your account, stop your node by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal.

**Enroll in Node Rewards**

    - Run the following command in your terminal
      ```bash copy
      nano conf/nxt.properties
      ```
    - Add `nxt.myPlatform=BLX-__-___-___-___` where `BLX-___-___-___-___` is your new account address.  Press
    `CTRL+X`, `ENTER` to save the file.

    - Restart your node as a background service
      ```bash copy
      ./run.sh --daemon
      ```
    - Verify that your node is properly configured [here](https://blue0x.com/node.html)

**Congratulations! You are now running a public Blue0x Node!**

**Your rewards will arrive soon!**
